# YouPAL - Youtube Playlist Artist Lister

It will give you a simple WebUI to add the YouTube playlist and provide an API where it will list the MusicBrainz information.

The goal is to create an app that would provide a custom list for Lidarr to tap into.

This is a WORK IN PROGMESS project, came up with the idea and created a quick solution for it under a lunch break.
The solution is 100%, still in development mode and can have some flaws as I haven't done any testing nor properly package it.
